    <h1>PATTERNS AND TRENDS IN U.S. WILDFIRES OVER 24 YEARS</h1>
    <h3>Priyanka Adhikari, Ruchira Banerjee, Simone Kaplunov, Luana Siyoum</h3>
    <h1>INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY</h1>
    <h3>Topic Introduction</h3>

    <p>
      Our topic is focused on wildfires across the United States that took place between 1992 and 2015. U.S. wildfires are important to analyze as they impact 
      people, wildlife, the economy, and communities/ecosystems across the country. They are the cause of extensive harm from 
      spreading air pollution to long-term vegetation damage. Therefore, analyzing historic wildfires could help make informed,
      preventative decisions about future wildfires. With climate change on the rise, it will also be interesting to see wildfire 
      incidents over time. It's important to consider the locations, causes, dates, sizes, and other patterns of past wildfires 
      to perhaps be able to assess risks, understand causes, and improve prevention strategies. Overall, analyzing wildfires 
      could help with both immediate damage responses to long-term planning for reducing their effects or limiting their 
      occurrences. This information can then be especially useful to policymakers but also the general public as they can be 
      directly or indirectly affected. 
      </p>

    <h3>Summary and Future Work</h3>

    <p>Overall, some of the main takeaways we've gathered from our analysis include that CA, GA, and TX had the most wildfires, which is a helpful statistic 
      to policymakers as they can raise awareness in these states and implement policies to prevent future fires. We also noted a large overall decrease in 
      wildfire occurrences from 2006 to 2015, indicating that some progress may have already started in these states. One of the biggest takeaways was that 
      most wildfires are caused by human actions, whether it be a result of campfires, smoking, or railroads, this ultimately means that we need to prevent 
      these accidents in the future. Future work includes creating a dashboard to let us explore how different causes of fire relate between states, including county-level data in visualizations for more intricate analyses, and maintaining a live database of wildfires for an up-to-date dashboard.

    <h3>References</h3>
    <p>Our analysis of patterns and trends in US wildfires over 24 years is informed by the understanding of contextual 
      factors and consequences associated with wildfires. <a href="https://www.rff.org/publications/explainers/wildfires-in-the-united-states-101-context-and-consequences/">Resources for the Future</a> provides insights into the broader 
      understanding of wildfires in the United States, highlighting their increasing severity, economic impact, and the 
      role of climate change in the growing wildfire risk. The understanding is further emphasized by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2022/wildfire-risk-map-us/">The Washington Post</a> 
      which goes into the in-depth analysis of wildfire risk, revealing that nearly 80 million properties across the 
      country suffer significant exposure to fire, with projections that indicate a growing threat to communities in the 
      coming decades. By incorporating these insights into our project, we aim to not only analyze historical wildfire data 
      but also contribute to informed decision-making for future wildfire prevention and mitigation strategies. Our goal is to 
      provide policymakers and the general public with actionable insights derived from comprehensive data analysis and 
      visualization.</p>
      
    <h1>WILDFIRE DATA</h1>
    <h3>Introduction to the data</h3>

    <p> The wildfire dataset we used was compiled from multiple federal, state, and local fire reports. 
        The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle, however the original dataset format was a sqlite database, so it was necessary to convert the sqlite database to a pandas dataframe, 
        then save the dataframe as a csv file to make the data easier to work with. 
        The dataset consists of 1.88 million geo-referenced wildfire records, and represents 140 million acres of land burned that occurred in the United States from 1992 to 2015. 
        The dataframe initially had 51 columns, and to clean our data, we went through the raw data and selected relevant variables, which included the following features:

        <p> After cleaning and dropping rows with invalid values, our new dataframe had 14 columns and 1880464 rows. 
            In conjunction with our wildfire dataset, we used geographical information from <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/">Natural Earth</a> in order to 
            make our maps to better visualize the wildfire locations.

            To gain a high-level understanding of our data, we looked at the average fire size for each of the different causes of fire outlined in the dataset. 
            As seen by the graph below, the largest fires seen in our dataset were due to lightning.

        <h3>Map of Wildfire Sizes Across the U.S.</h3>
        
        <div class = 'image'>
          <iframe src="wildfire_map.png" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>
        <div class = 'text'>
          <p> Here we present a map of wildfire sizes across the U.S., specifically representing fire sizes
            by acres within the final perimeter of the fire. A red color map is used to signify
            smaller fires (lighter red) to larger fires (darker red). We can identify that Alaska has larger fires overall,
            but the amount doesn't cover the whole state. This is somewhat surprising since Alaska is a relatively cold state
            simultaneously understandable that the fires are larger perhaps due to less population and vast nature. In general,
            this map allows us to see that there are smaller fires on the coasts (specifically the west and northeast),
            and there are medium sized fires more towards the middle of the U.S. This could be due to population reasons
            and access to coast water/coast climate.

        <h3>Line Chart of Wildfire Occurrences over the Years</h3>

        <div class = 'container'>
          <div class = 'text'>
              <p> Moreover, we wanted to examine wildfire occurrences over the years (from 1992 to 2015).
                Since we are utilizing Altair, it's important to note the restriction of having chosen a random 5000 data points
                as opposed to the whole data set. 
              </p>
              <p> The line chart shows the peak amount of fires occurring around 2006, while the
                lowest amount of fires was around 1993. In general, the amount of wildfires consistently increases and decreases every few years. 
                Although there does seem to be an ever so slight increasing trend, which aligns with global warming, but surprisingly not too much.

        <h3>Bar Chart of Wildfire Occurrences by U.S. State</h3>

        <div class = 'container'>
          <div class = 'text'>
              <p> This bar chart allows us to examine the fires by state utilizing D3. We can clearly identify California (189,550), Georgia (168,867), and Texas (142,021)
                as having the most wildfires, and Vermont (456), Delaware (171), and D.C. (66) as having the least wildfire occurrences.
                It's interesting that the states with the least amount of wildfires are all in the northeast, which makes sense given the colder climate.
              </p>
              <p> 
                There is clearly a drastic difference between the amount of wildfires overall since it ranges from 66 to 189,550.
                There also seems to be a steep decrease in wildfire occurrences between the top states, and then the trend has a relatively steady decrease after 50,000 fires.
